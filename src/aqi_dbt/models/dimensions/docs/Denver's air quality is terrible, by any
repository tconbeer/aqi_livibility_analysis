Denver's air quality is terrible, by any measure. We've seen each of the last 4 years with over 100 days where parts of the city have unlivible air. Unlike wildfire-prone Truckee, Denver's problems are distributed throughout the summer and fall months, not concentrated in August or September.

The last two years have seen the air problems more widespread throughout the MSA (rather than confined to a single site). Indeed, using the Mean AQI metric, the crisis in 2021 seems unprecedented; however, the Max AQI metric shows that the underlying issues were here all along.

Salt Lake City is the only other MSA that rivals Denver's poor performance. 

Boulder is dramatically better, which is surprising, given its proximity (we need to confirm that Ozone is monitored reliably in Boulder). Boulder's trend is much worse the past two years, but still better than most other MSAs.
