      The raw data in stg_aqi_daily_sites has a very fine grain, and is missing
      nearly half of the entries needed to join cleanly with 
      stg_aqi_hourly_observations. Here we aggregate by site_id and select
      the most recent daily record for each site

    columns:
      - name: site_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: site_name
