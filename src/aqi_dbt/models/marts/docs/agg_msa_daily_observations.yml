    description: >
      This model aggregates fct_aqi_hourly_observations twice, first
      across all sites in an MSA, and then across all hours in a day.

      The key metric is the AQI; there are a few ways to aggregate
      AQI; we take both the mean and max across sites, and then
      the (simple) mean and max across hours of the day. We
      also count the number of hours that the site mean and max are
      above our defined "livibility" threshold.
