    description: >
      This macro takes an observation (with its units) of a parameter,
      and returns the equivalent on the AQI scale.

      Only works for OZONE, PM2.5, and PM10 parameters; all other 
      parameters will have a null AQI.

      The AQI equation is a linear interpolation with breakpoints that
      are specific to each parameter. For details, see:

    arguments:
      - name: parameter_name
        type: string
        description: >
          A field name (as a string) or a string literal of an EPA
          parameter. Currently only data values corresponding to
          OZONE, PM2.5, or PM10 will generate an AQI.
      - name: reporting_units
        type: string
        description: >
          The units of the observed value. Must be in PPB for OZONE,
          or UG/M3 for PM2.5 or PM10
      - name: observed_value
        type: string
        description: >
          The value to be interpolated into the AQI equation.
